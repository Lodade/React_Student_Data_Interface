# React_Student_Data_Interface

The original javaScript source code files are in the javaScript_source_files folder. These
are the original .jsx react files that all the code was written in. These files were
then converted into .js files using babel. These .js files reside in the javaScript folder.
The webapp should run without any use of babel on your end but the original files .jsx are visible
for viewing.
